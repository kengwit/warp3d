Patwarp directory
-----------------

In this directory are the source code and compile scripts (bash
for Linux and OSX, .bat for Windows) for the patwarp program.

The patwarp program converts Patran neutral (text) files into WARP3D input
files. 

The special Linux version that supported domain decomposition for 
MPI solutions has been removed.

The Linux version of patwarp is now the same as Windows and Mac.

Files in this directory are:

README -- this file

compile_patwarp_osx -- script that compiles patwarp for MacOS
                       Intel processors only. 

compile_patwarp_linux -- script that compiles patwarp for Linux 
                         
patwarp.f -- patwarp source code all 3 platforms

compile_patwarp_windows.bat --compile script Windows W10

Note:

  Building patwarp on each platform requires the Intel Fortran
  compiler ifort.  It likely will compile with Intel ifx
  and gfortran

Running patwarp
---------------

patwarp asks questions about the neutral file, output file,
and other information needed in creating the WARP3D input file.

More information about running patwarp can be found in the Appendix to
the WARP3D User Manual.
